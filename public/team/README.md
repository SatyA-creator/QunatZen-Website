## Fallback System:
The application uses high-quality Unsplash images as fallbacks if local images are not available. You can replace these with actual team member photos when available.

## Usage:
Images are automatically loaded with:
1. Primary: Unsplash fallback images (currently active)
2. Secondary: Local images from this folder (when available)
3. Default: Generated avatar icon (if both fail)
