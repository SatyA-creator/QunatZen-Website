# üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - Backend Not Working

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Backend Health:** ‚úÖ RUNNING (https://qunatzen-backend.onrender.com/health returns 200)

**Problem:** ‚ùå Subscribe endpoint returns 500 error

---

## üéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The backend is running but the **subscribe endpoint is failing with a 500 Internal Server Error**. This means:

1. ‚úÖ Backend deployed successfully
2. ‚úÖ Server is running
3. ‚ùå **Email configuration is missing or incorrect in Render**

---

## üî• QUICK FIX (Follow These Steps)

### Step 1: Check Render Environment Variables

Go to your Render dashboard:
1. Open [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Click on your `quantzen-backend` service
3. Go to **"Environment"** tab on the left
4. **Verify these variables are set:**

```
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 3001
EMAIL_HOST = smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = your-16-character-app-password
EMAIL_FROM = your-gmail-address@gmail.com
FRONTEND_URL = https://zenith-studio-ten.vercel.app
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 5
```

### Step 2: Gmail App Password (CRITICAL!)

‚ö†Ô∏è **You MUST use a Gmail App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password!**

#### How to Generate Gmail App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail:**
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Find "2-Step Verification" and turn it ON
   - Complete the setup

2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other" as the device
   - Name it "QuantZen Backend"
   - Click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Update Render Environment Variable:**
   - In Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Environment
   - Find `EMAIL_PASS`
   - Paste the 16-character app password (remove spaces)
   - Click "Save Changes"

### Step 3: Update FRONTEND_URL for CORS

Currently your backend only allows: `https://zenith-studio-ten.vercel.app/`

**If your frontend is at a different URL:**
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Environment
2. Update `FRONTEND_URL` to match your actual frontend URL
3. Remove the trailing slash: `https://your-domain.vercel.app` (no `/` at end)
4. Save changes

### Step 4: Redeploy Backend

After updating environment variables:
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Your service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

### Step 5: Test Again

Once deployment is done, test:

**Option A - Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Test health
curl https://qunatzen-backend.onrender.com/health

# Test subscribe
$body = @{ email = "test@example.com" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://qunatzen-backend.onrender.com/api/subscribe" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Option B - Using Browser:**
Open: `http://localhost:5173/test-connection.html` (if running frontend locally)

**Option C - Using the verification script:**
```powershell
node backend/verify-backend.js https://qunatzen-backend.onrender.com
```

## üîç COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Email authentication failed"
**Cause:** Using regular Gmail password instead of App Password
**Solution:** Generate Gmail App Password (see Step 2 above)

### Issue 2: "EAUTH" error in logs
**Cause:** Wrong email credentials
**Solution:** 
- Double-check `EMAIL_USER` is your full Gmail address
- Double-check `EMAIL_PASS` is the 16-char app password
- Make sure no spaces in the app password

### Issue 3: "CORS error" in browser console
**Cause:** `FRONTEND_URL` doesn't match your actual frontend domain
**Solution:** Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Render to match exactly (no trailing slash)

### Issue 4: "ECONNECTION" error
**Cause:** Wrong email port or host
**Solution:** 
- Verify `EMAIL_HOST = smtp.gmail.com`
- Verify `EMAIL_PORT = 587` (NOT 465)

### Issue 5: Backend "spins down" on free tier
**Cause:** Render free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity
**Solution:** 
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds
- Either wait or upgrade to paid tier ($7/month)
- Or switch to Railway ($5/month)

## üìã COMPLETE CHECKLIST

Before testing:
- [ ] 2FA enabled on Gmail
- [ ] App Password generated (16 characters)
- [ ] All environment variables set in Render
- [ ] `EMAIL_PASS` uses App Password (not regular password)
- [ ] `EMAIL_PORT` is `587` (not 465)
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` matches your domain exactly
- [ ] Backend redeployed after env var changes
- [ ] Waited 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

---

## üß™ VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### In Render Dashboard:

Check these EXACT values:

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST     = smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT     = 587
EMAIL_USER     = youremail@gmail.com         # Your full Gmail address
EMAIL_PASS     = abcdefghijklmnop            # 16-char app password (no spaces)
EMAIL_FROM     = youremail@gmail.com         # Same as EMAIL_USER

# Server Configuration  
NODE_ENV       = production
PORT           = 3001

# CORS Configuration
FRONTEND_URL   = https://your-frontend.vercel.app    # NO trailing slash!

# Rate Limiting
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 5
```

## üö® CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ‚ùå Using your regular Gmail password instead of App Password
2. ‚ùå Not enabling 2FA before generating App Password
3. ‚ùå Including spaces in the App Password
4. ‚ùå Using port 465 instead of 587
5. ‚ùå Adding trailing slash to FRONTEND_URL
6. ‚ùå Not redeploying after changing environment variables
7. ‚ùå Testing immediately after deploy (wait 2-3 min)

## üìû STILL NOT WORKING?

### Check Render Logs:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for errors when you try to subscribe
5. Common errors to look for:
   - "EAUTH" ‚Üí Wrong credentials
   - "ECONNECTION" ‚Üí Wrong host/port
   - "Invalid login" ‚Üí App Password not set
   - "535 authentication failed" ‚Üí Wrong password

### Get Help:

1. Copy the error from Render logs
2. Check if email credentials are correct
3. Verify 2FA is enabled on Gmail
4. Try generating a new App Password
5. Make sure no firewall blocking SMTP

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it works when:
- ‚úÖ Health check returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Subscribe endpoint returns success message
- ‚úÖ Email arrives in test inbox
- ‚úÖ No errors in Render logs
- ‚úÖ Frontend subscription form works

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX

1. Test with real email address
2. Update frontend `.env.production` if needed
3. Redeploy frontend if already deployed
4. Test end-to-end: Form ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Email
5. Monitor logs for first 24 hours

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

- **Keep App Password secure** - treat it like a real password
- **Test locally first** with same env vars
- **Use Railway** ($5/mo) if Render free tier is too slow
- **Monitor your Gmail sending limits** (500 emails/day)
- **Set up email forwarding** to track sent emails

Good luck! The most common issue is the App Password. Make sure you follow Step 2 carefully! üöÄ
