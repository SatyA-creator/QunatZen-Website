### 2. Find Your Service

Click on: **`quantzen-backend`** (or whatever you named it)

## 🔑 CRITICAL: Gmail App Password

### You MUST use App Password (NOT your regular Gmail password!)

#### Quick Steps:

1. **Go to:** https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   
2. **If you see "App passwords":**
   - Click it
   - Select "Mail" 
   - Select "Other"
   - Type "QuantZen"
   - Click "Generate"
   - **COPY the 16-character code**

3. **If you DON'T see "App passwords":**
   - First enable 2FA: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Turn on "2-Step Verification"
   - Then try step 2 again

4. **In Render:**
   - Find `EMAIL_PASS` variable
   - Paste the 16-character code (remove spaces)
   - Example: `abcdefghijklmnop`

## 📝 EXACT Values to Set in Render

```
EMAIL_HOST
smtp.gmail.com

EMAIL_PORT  
587

EMAIL_USER
your-actual-email@gmail.com

EMAIL_PASS
your-16-char-app-password

EMAIL_FROM
your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

**⚠️ Replace the placeholder values with YOUR actual email and app password!**

---

## 💾 Save & Redeploy

1. After setting ALL 5 variables, click **"Save Changes"**
2. Render will automatically redeploy (you'll see logs scrolling)
3. **WAIT 2-3 minutes** for deployment to finish
4. Look for "Live" status (green dot)

---

## 🧪 Test It

### Option 1 - PowerShell Command:
```powershell
$body = @{ email = "test@example.com" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://qunatzen-backend.onrender.com/api/subscribe" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Option 2 - Your Website:
1. Go to your website
2. Enter an email in subscription form
3. Click subscribe
4. Check email inbox

---

## ✅ SUCCESS SIGNS

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ No error message on website
- ✅ "Thank you for subscribing!" message appears
- ✅ Email arrives in inbox (check spam too!)
- ✅ No errors in Render logs

---

## ❌ STILL FAILING?

### Check Render Logs:

1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Try subscribing again
4. Look for error message

### Common Errors:

**"EAUTH" or "Invalid login"**
→ You're using regular password, not App Password
→ Fix: Generate App Password (see above)

**"535 5.7.8 Authentication failed"**
→ App Password is wrong or has spaces
→ Fix: Generate new App Password, paste without spaces

**"ECONNECTION"**
→ Wrong port or host
→ Fix: Verify EMAIL_PORT is `587` and EMAIL_HOST is `smtp.gmail.com`
